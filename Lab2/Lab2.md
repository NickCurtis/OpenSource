2. Licenses allow you to choose the rights you have over your program, and allow you to monetize or freely distribute your code. Licenses foster the open source/free software community which helps everybody make better code.\

3. Using and modifying a project with no explicit license makes you liable to be sued as the project is by default proprietary to the owner. Since you never got permission to use/modifying the code, your infringing on copyright.

4. The open system model allow developers to meaningfully change the project as it is being developed. By developing the most important protocols behind closed doors and releasing them when completed, Gopher was removing the open development culture. This made the community feel they weren't important and rightly abandoned ship.\

5. OS's are arguably the most complicated programs in existence. Obviously the development of them are very complicated and most do not wish develop them for free for the common good. Linux's decision to use GPL v2.0 allows people to use a free OS, where all they ask is that any improvements they make to the OS they make for the entire community. This relatively quickly develops Linux with many small contributions.\

7. For the common good, Apache allows anyone to do anything that he or she wants with it including sublicensing. For a company, GPL allows them to create a profitable product, while also guranteeing that open development will in turn be open. In this way, the company is helping themselves. For these same reasons, GPL is best for developers. They turn single person development into teams working to improve the project in multiple ways.\

9. I'm primarily interested in working on some kind of AI project. Most likely I will make my term project my Rock Raiders team competition where I will be specifically working on the autonomy part of the robot. I have a certain affinity for the GPL license and would like to see the project ultimately be a nice, little working robot framework for others, likely next year's team, to use. Users will be the Rock Raiders team itself or do-it-yourselfers.
